# Signalboy Service
## TODOS
- [ ] Implement auto-retry connection once Signalboy-Service is running.
- [ ] Rewrite SignalboyService as an Android Bound Service
  (s. [Android SDK documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth/connect-gatt-server#setup-bound-service) for a reference implementation)
- [x] Make sure that uncaught exceptions thrown in background won't crash the Unity player.
